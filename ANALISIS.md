Smart Contracts 

    Using smart contracts to replicate and improve on existing organizational mechanisms
    Efficiencies, transparencies, and accountabilities in contractual engagements (i.e. multi-sig contracts that guarantee certain actors were involved)
    Transparency in distribution of resources (can we better show where our money is going?)
    Interactions across groups (what would a SWIFT code for development look like, if described in Solidity?)
    Increasing access and use of tokenized systems by creating more user friendly and more secure interfaces

Analyzing data

    Using machine learning to understand the activities on public blockchains.
    Can we develop unicity from transactions on public blockchains?
    Could we use crypto-flows to help organizations  and governments do and understand their transactions more efficiently? Can we use blockchain data to solve humanitarian challenges? (i.e. using bitcoin data to fight human trafficking)

Tokens

    Can crypto tokens work to incentivize or support behavior that benefits humanity?
    How could we connect various tokens to each other to maximize human potential?
    How could we utilize digital scarcity, non-fungible tokens, or digital collectibles for social good?

Mining

    Can we use passive distributed mining networks to create investment funding opportunities **Mehrwert**?
